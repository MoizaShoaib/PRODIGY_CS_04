# PRODIGY_CS_04
This repository contains a simple C++ keylogger program for Windows. The keylogger runs in the background and captures keystrokes from the user, logging them into a text file.

Features

Background Keylogging: The keylogger captures keystrokes while running in the background without interrupting the user's activities.

Customizable Output: Keystrokes are logged into a text file named keylogger.txt.

Graceful Termination: The keylogger can be terminated gracefully by pressing Ctrl+C.
